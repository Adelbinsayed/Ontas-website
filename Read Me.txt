It is a very simple website that I've made to test my CSS ability ..
Name : Ontas ONline shopping BD
Number of Page : 1
(Please open the index.html file to view the tiny site)
#popup menu added for signing Up
#cool hover effect on navigation menu
#attractive hover/active states for buttons
#and also responsive for tablets ans screen size up to 600px
#all measurements are in REM so that shrinking the screen size will also shrink the images 
and font sizes as well as the icons and buttons

Thanks for viewing...
